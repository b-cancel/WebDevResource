# WebDevResource

For the first 7 Assignments
1. get XAMPP
2. place this folder in the "htdocs" folder inside of the "xampp" folder
3. the root of "htdocs" is "http://localhost/" on your web browser
4. travel to wherever you placed this folder on the web browser
*Assuming you place this folder in the root of "htdocs" your url should be "http://localhost/WebDevResource-master/"
5. in the web browser select the assignment and run one of the html files. Everything should work.

For the other Assignments. You need to setup the database and slim. I will try to get the instructions for doing this soon.
